For this dataset, 99% of the data are useable (successful SLAM), with 0 demonstrations dropped. If your dataset has a low SLAM success rate, double check if you carefully followed our [data collection instruction](https://swanky-sphere-ad1.notion.site/UMI-Data-Collection-Instruction-4db1a1f0f2aa4a2e84d9742720428b4c). 

Despite our significant effort on robustness improvement, OBR_SLAM3 is still the most fragile part of UMI pipeline. If you are an expert in SLAM, please consider contributing to our fork of [OBR_SLAM3](https://github.com/cheng-chi/ORB_SLAM3) which is specifically optimized for UMI workflow.

Generate dataset for training.
```console
python scripts_slam_pipeline/07_generate_replay_buffer.py -o example_demo_session/dataset.zarr.zip example_demo_session
```

## Training Diffusion Policy
Single-GPU training. Tested to work on RTX3090 24GB.
```console
python train.py --config-name=train_diffusion_unet_timm_umi_workspace task.dataset_path=example_demo_session/dataset.zarr.zip
```

Multi-GPU training.
```console
accelerate --num_processes <ngpus> train.py --config-name=train_diffusion_unet_timm_umi_workspace task.dataset_path=example_demo_session/dataset.zarr.zip
```

Downloading in-the-wild cup arrangement dataset (processed).
```console

```

Multi-GPU training.
```console

```

## ü¶æ Real-world Deployment
In this section, we will demonstrate our real-world deployment/evaluation system with the cup arrangement policy. While this policy setup only requires a single arm and camera, the our system supports up to 2 arms and unlimited number of cameras.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Setup
1. Build deployment hardware according to our [Hardware Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TPYwV9sNVPAi0ZlAupDMkXZ4CA1hsZx7YDMSmcEy6EU).
2. Setup UR5 with teach pendant:
    * Obtain IP address and update [eval_robots_config.yaml](example/eval_robots_config.yaml)/robots/robot_ip.
    * In Installation > Payload
        * Set mass to 1.81 kg
        * Set center of gravity to (2, -6, 37)mm, CX/CY/CZ.
    * TCP will be set automatically by the eval script.
    * On UR5e, switch control mode to remote.

    If you are using Franka, follow this [instruction](franka_instruction.md).
3. Setup WSG50 gripper with web interface:
    * Obtain IP address and update [eval_robots_config.yaml](example/eval_robots_config.yaml)/grippers/gripper_ip.
    * In Settings > Command Interface
        * Disable "Use text based Interface"
        * Enable CRC
    * In Scripting > File Manager
        * Upload [umi/real_world/cmd_measure.lua](umi/real_world/cmd_measure.lua)
    * In Settings > System
        * Enable Startup Script
        * Select `/user/cmd_measure.lua` you just uploaded.
4. Setup GoPro:
    * Install GoPro Labs [firmware](https://gopro.com/en/us/info/gopro-labs).
    * Set date and time.
    * Scan the following QR code for clean HDMI output 
    <br><img width="50%" src="assets/QR-MHDMI1mV0r27Tp60fWe0hS0sLcFg1dV.png">
5. Setup [3Dconnexion SpaceMouse](https://www.amazon.com/3Dconnexion-SpaceMouse-Wireless-universal-receiver/dp/B079V367MM):
    * Install libspnav `sudo apt install libspnav-dev spacenavd`
    * Start spnavd `sudo systemctl start spacenavd`

### ü§ó Reproducing the Cup Arrangement Policy ‚òï
Our in-the-wild cup arragement policy is trained with the distribution of ["espresso cup with saucer"](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=espresso+cup+with+saucer) on Amazon across 30 different locations around Stanford. We created a [Amazon shopping list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/Q0T8U2N5U3IU?ref_=wl_share) for all cups used for training. We published the processed [Zarr dataset and](https://real.stanford.edu/umi/data/zarr_datasets) pre-trained [checkpoint](https://real.stanford.edu/umi/data/pretrained_models/) (finetuned CLIP ViT-L backbone).

<img width="90%" src="assets/umi_cup.gif">

Download pre-trained checkpoint.
```console
wget https://real.stanford.edu/umi/data/pretrained_models/cup_wild_vit_l_1img.ckpt
```

Grant permission to the HDMI capture card.
```console
sudo chmod -R 777 /dev/bus/usb
```

Launch eval script.
```console
python eval_real.py --robot_config=example/eval_robots_config.yaml -i cup_wild_vit_l.ckpt -o data/eval_cup_wild_example
```
After the script started, use your spacemouse to control the robot and the gripper (spacemouse buttons). Press `C` to start the policy. Press `S` to stop.

If everything are setup correctly, your robot should be able to rotate the cup and placing it onto the saucer, anywhere üéâ

Known issue ‚ö†Ô∏è: The policy doesn't work well under direct sunlight, since the dataset was collected during a rainiy week at Stanford.
